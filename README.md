# Cracking the Coding Interview

Are you preparing for job interviews in the field of computer science? Do you feel overwhelmed by the sheer number of programming questions on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and GeeksForGeeks? Nowadays, many companies hiring students for positions such as Data Scientist or Software Engineer require candidates to solve programming problems during interviews. However, the common advice for interview preparation is to solve as many programming problems as possible, which is a daunting task that often takes months of dedicated practice.

To alleviate the burden of interview preparation, the **[UArizona DataLab](https://www.datascience.arizona.edu/education/uarizona-datalab)** from the  [**Data Science Institute**](https://www.datascience.arizona.edu/) is offering a 12-week workshop series called ***"Cracking the coding interview"*** this semester (Spring 2024). In this workshop, we will discuss tricks, tips, and patterns commonly found in programming interview questions. We will also cover the foundational knowledge necessary to solve these questions. The best part? It's completely free. See below for more details.

Please join us in-person at the **Weaver Science & Engineering Library Room 212**, or join via Zoom: **[864 232 23879](https://arizona.zoom.us/j/86423223879), starting February 7th at 3PM,** and happening every Wednesday.

**Mandatory Pre-requisites:** Any programming experience including python

**Preferred Pre-requisites:** Familiarity with C programming and Java.

Everything I learned is from this amazing guru, Kamal Rawat of [Ritambhara Technologies](https://www.ritambhara.in/). Do watch his videos if you have time. He explains things soooooo much better than I do..I am just standing on the shoulders of giants like him in an effort to share the knowledge I learned from them.
